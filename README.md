## <a id="readme-general"></a>OASIS TC Open Repository: openc2-custom-aps

This GitHub public repository [openc2-custom-aps](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-custom-aps) was created at the request of the [OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

## <a id="purposeStatement"></a>Statement of Purpose

- Providing a publicly available repository for Custom Actuator Profiles, and
- Supporting collaborative development of OpenC2 Custom Actuator Profiles.

OpenC2 allows for actuator profiles other than those that are OASIS specifications. It allows for "extensions" by vendors or users. This repository enables interested parties who want to work collaboratively on Custom Actuator Profiles (CAP).

The qualifier "custom" is used to distinguish between actuator profiles being drafted as OASIS Specifications and those "custom" profiles being developed as extensions to a specification (e.g., providing vendor-specific or user-specific options) or to support a particular technology that does not yet have a specification.

The creation of OpenC2 actuator profile specifications is not necessarily a goal for this openc2-custom-aps repository, but the custom profiles in the repository may serve to inform the actuator profile subcommittee.

**Additions to Statement of Purpose**

Repository Maintainers may include here any additional sections, subsections, and paragraphs that the Maintainer(s) wish to add as descriptive text, reflecting project status, milestones, releases, modifications to statement of purpose, etc.  The project Maintainers will create and maintain this content on behalf of the participants.
